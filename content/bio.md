Artist, Producer, and Engineer from Geneva, Switzerland.
Born in Santiago de Chile in 1997, but am by nationality Half Croatian Half Swiss.

Started playing piano around age 11 and learning other people's songs but stopped after a few years.
I developed a passion for performing in middle school and high school when performing covers in school assemblies, accompanying myself on guitar.
I began songwriting and recording in 2017, producing in 2018, and am releasing my Debut Album "Rage Therapy" in 2023. 

My music is aimed at helping healing through alchemizing trauma/stress energy by raging, and providing emotional support through connection and a different perspective on approaching life's problems.
I am heavily inspired by hard rock music, and in particular Red Hot Chili Peppers -s/o to John Frusciante.‚Ä®
My production features a broad range of styles within trap and leans on the heavier side- I never ever follow trends and produce, sing and rap straight from the heart.

I managed to beat an extremely intense depression that lasted over a year and a half- so I serve as the proof that those who are currently suffering can fully beat it too ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•.
